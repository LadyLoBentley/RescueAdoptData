# RescueAdoptData
This repository explores dog adoption trends across different locations using data analysis and visualization. The project investigates factors affecting adoption rates, geographic patterns, and potential correlations between location demographics and adoption success.

# üê∂ Dog Adoption Location Trends  
## üìå Overview  
This project analyzes dog adoption trends across different locations using data from Kaggle. The goal is to explore factors influencing adoption rates, uncover geographic trends, and provide insights into improving adoption success. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations, this study aims to help shelters and potential adopters understand the dynamics of dog adoption.
